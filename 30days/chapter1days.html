                        Time is supposed to be fair. Each day gives us 24 hours, 1,440 minutes, 86,400 seconds. But when you’re told that you only have thirty more days to live, time stops feeling fair—it feels like a cruel joke. <br>
                        
                        My name is Haruki Reiya. I’m seventeen years old. And I am dying.<br>
                        
                        This is not a story about how I fought against death. It’s a story about how I found life—in a girl with soft eyes, quiet strength, and a heart that was too big for this world.<br>
                        
                        Her name is Misaki Amari. And these are the thirty days we shared. <br><br><br>
                        
                        
                        
                        <b>Chapter 1: The Staircase Encounter</b> <br> <br>
                        
                        It was an ordinary Tuesday. The kind of day that slips by unnoticed by most, but I remember every second.<br>
                        
                        My chest had been tight all morning. I could feel it creeping in like fog over a lake—subtle, but impossible to ignore. The hallways felt longer, the stairs steeper. The distant chatter of classmates echoed in my ears like the background noise of a world I was slowly slipping away from.
                        And then, the world tilted.<br>
                        
                        
                        The edges of my vision went dark, my breathing grew shallow, and my knees gave out. Just as I was about to collapse on the cold steps of the school stairwell, a hand reached out and caught me.<br>
                        
                        It wasn’t strong or forceful—it was gentle, but firm. Steadying.<br><br>
                        
                        “Hey!” a girl’s voice cried out. “Are you okay?”<br><br>
                        
                        I blinked, and the blur became a girl around my age. She was kneeling beside me, worry etched in every line of her face. She had dark hair pulled into a braid, her school uniform perfectly neat, except for a tiny ink stain near the collar.<br>
                        
                        She wasn’t the kind of girl who turned heads in hallways. But something about her held me there—her calm eyes, her steady breathing, the way she didn’t freak out like most people might.<br><br>
                        
                        “I... I’m fine,” I managed to say, even though I wasn’t. Pride answered before honesty could.<br><br>
                        
                        She frowned. “You don’t look fine. Can you sit up?”<br><br>
                        
                        She helped me to the edge of the step, careful not to make a big scene. Students walked by, some casting glances, others ignoring us entirely. To them, we were just background noise.<br><br>
                        
                        “I’m Misaki,” she said after a pause. Her voice was soft, like the wind before a storm.<br><br>
                        
                        “Haruki.” <br><br>
                        
                        We sat like that for a while. Me trying to catch my breath, her pretending not to stare too hard. I could see the questions forming in her mind, but she didn’t ask them. That silence was oddly comforting.
                        
                        Then, just before she stood up, she smiled gently.<br><br>
                        
                        “You should take care of yourself, Haruki.”<br><br>
                        It was the first time someone had said my name like that—in a way that made it feel like I mattered.
                        I didn’t know it then, but that staircase was the beginning of something beautiful.
