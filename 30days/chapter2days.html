                    <p><b>Chapter 2: Library Echoes</b><br><br>

                        After that day, I began noticing her. Maybe she was always there, or maybe life had finally decided to give me something worth holding onto.<br>
                        
                        She always sat by the window in the library during lunch, her notebook open, sometimes sketching, sometimes scribbling poetry in a language I could never fully decipher from afar.<br>
                        
                        I started going to the library too. At first, I told myself it was just for the peace and quiet. But the truth was simple: I wanted to see her again.<br>
                        
                        We exchanged glances. Small smiles. And then, finally, words.<br><br>
                        
                        "The Fault in Our Stars?" she asked one day, tilting her head.<br><br>
                        
                        I looked down at the book in my hands. “Yeah.”<br><br>
                        
                        “I’ve read it three times. It hurts. But it’s honest.”<br><br>
                        
                        I nodded slowly. “I like it because it doesn’t lie. It tells you straight up—some stories just aren’t meant to end happily.”<br><br>
                        
                        She looked at me, and for a second, her expression softened into something fragile.<br><br>
                        
                        “Real stories rarely do,” she whispered.<br><br>
                        That was the beginning of our daily meetings. We never planned them, but somehow, we always ended up in the same corner of the library. She would draw while I read. Sometimes we’d talk, sometimes not. But it never felt awkward. It just felt right.
                        <br>
                        She showed me her sketches once. They were beautiful. Melancholic. Lonely.<br><br>
                        
                        “Why don’t you draw faces?” I asked.<br><br>
                        
                        “I don’t know what they look like,” she answered. “Not really. But I know how they feel.”<br><br>
                        
                        Every day I was with her, I forgot about the clock ticking inside me. I forgot that my life had an expiration date. All I could think about was her—and how being around her made me feel alive.
